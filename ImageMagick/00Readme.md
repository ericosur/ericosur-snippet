# readme for folder ImageMagick

Most perl scripts here are using Image::Magick to perform image editing.
Some scripts started **gm** are using Graphics::Magick. It is nearly seamless
to convert Image::Magick script to Graphics::Magick. Only replace __"Image::Magick"__
to __"Graphics::Magick""__ and jobs done.
