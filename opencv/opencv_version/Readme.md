# readme

A opencv hello world to show version of currently included opencv hpp.

## why

By default opencv installed in **/usr/include** or **/usr/local/include** is used.
If intel openVINO is installed, and env vars is used. OpenCV version would be
different.

## using intel openvino

```
$ source /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/bin/setupvars.sh
```
