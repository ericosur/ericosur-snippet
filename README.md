# ericosur-snippet

Here are my code snippets, playground, tests, and prototypes.


## composition

Most snippets are:
C/C++, perl, python, text,
javascript, graphviz, shell script, java,
windows batch/cmd, and etc...

## note

Though the most scripts are written in perl, they are not used or reviewed recently. In recent year I write python scripts to solve my problems.

## history

* 2017-02-22 move all qt/ into myqt.git
* 2014-08-18 migrate my snippets from gcode to github
