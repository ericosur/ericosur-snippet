# ericosur-snippet

Here are my code snippets, playground, tests, and prototypes.

Though the github.com says this repository is mainly perl, I use less and less 
perl in recent years. Currently I use python scripts more.

Most perl scripts are not well-functioned for now. Especially those uses external 
perl modules.

## composition

Most snippets are:
C/C++, perl, python, text,
javascript, graphviz, shell script, java,
windows batch/cmd, and etc...

## history

* 2017-02-22 move all qt/ into myqt.git
* 2014-08-18 migrate my snippets from gcode to github
