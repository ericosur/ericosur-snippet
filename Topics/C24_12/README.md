# Readme on 24C12

## description

c24.py is a python script to list combinations about a game that user selects 12 numbers from 1 to 24.
Total combinations are
$$ C^{12}_{24} = 2,704,156 $$


* All hit case is 1.
$$
1 \cdot 1 \cdot ... \cdot 1 = 1
$$

* All miss case is 1. For this case, if all answers are missed, there can be only one combination.
For example, a 10-number-in-a-set, the correct combination to get the grand prize is $(1,2,3,4,5)$. Then the only combination to missing all the numbers is $(6,7,8,9,10)$.

* Only one hit, 11 misses case is 144.
$$
C^{1}_{12} \cdot C^{11}_{12} = 144
$$
and its ratio is
$$
\frac{144}{2704156} = 5.325*10^{-5} = 0.005325\%
$$

* Two hits, 10 misses
$$
C^{2}_{12} \cdot C^{10}_{12} = 4356
$$

and its ratio is
$$
\frac{4356}{2704156} = 1.611*10^{-3} = 0.1611\%
$$
