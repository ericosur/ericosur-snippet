# C++ Sample: function pointer to class member function #

This simple stupid small C++ source project demos how to use
a function pointer to a member function, and how to invoke them.

In [foo.h][1] here is a class __foo__, will know how to *__typedef__*
a function pointer to member function.


[1]: ./foo.h
[2]: ./foo.cpp
