# readme

A sample to use iconv functions to do character transcoding.

## result

Should see the correct characters under mac/linux which
supports utf-8 encoding terminals.

## dependency

under my system, need manually build source tarball and install into /usr/local

* fetch source tarball from GNU: https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
* follow the steps to build and install
* default it will install to /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib
* check /usr/local/lib/libiconv.so.2 is available.
